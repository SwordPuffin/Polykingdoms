# Polykingdoms
An open source game similar to "The Battle Of Polytopia" and made with Unity
# 

Hey,

This game is a small side projects I have been working on for fun.

You are welcome to look at the code (I will add proper documentation when the game is finished), and you can even make suggestions if you want.

It'll get done eventually (I hope), and when it does, I hope you enjoy it!
